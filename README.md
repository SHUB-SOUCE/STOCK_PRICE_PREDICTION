# Stock Price Prediction

## About the Project
This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques applied to historical financial data.  
It has been implemented in Jupyter Notebook, where data preprocessing, visualization, and feature engineering were carried out before training predictive models.  
The work so far has included building and evaluating models that capture stock price trends with reasonable accuracy.  
Currently, the project is focusing on improving performance through hyperparameter tuning and exploring advanced models for better forecasting results.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Scikit-learn  
- TensorFlow / Keras (if deep learning models are used)  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
